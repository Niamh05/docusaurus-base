title: What I love about doing support
---
Like many people, when I first encounter a new thing, I'm excited and I want to try it out. But when that thing is a bit daunting, as technology can sometimes be, it can overshadow the excitement and happiness a person feels when they first open that new toy. That can quickly turn to frustration. My favorite part of doing support is when I can help someone get back to that state where they are excited to try out the new thing. Whether that new thing is a feature or a new workflow, it really makes my day when I can see the light and happiness come back to someone who was previously upset and frustrated.
