title: HTTPS, SSL AND DNS
---

I going to approach this conversation as if I were trying to explain it to my mom. 

SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer and is a safeguard against something nefarious intercepting the converstaion you're having with whatever website you are on. In most browsers, a small lock icon will appear indicating that you are using HTTPS. That happens when a website is secured with an SSL certificate. This is important anytime you are communicating any sensitive material- which could be as simple as using your full name. 

DNS is the acronym for Domain Name Server. The name of a website is a vital piece of infrastructure for nearly everything on the internet. Resolving those names to the IP addresses they live on can be chanlenging if it's not set up correctly. Another struggle faced by people trying to set up their DNS is that the hardware and network that hardware lives on needs to be very reliable. If it goes down, no one will be able to access the website.
