There are some good and bad things about most documentaiton sites. If you provide all the information, that can become cluttered and overwhelming, but if you provide too little, a person can become frustrated searching for answers that aren't there. I chose to talk about [Square's Documentation](https://squareup.com/help/us/en). I like that it is simplified enough that the page looks clean. The site is broken down into areas that lead me to where I need to go. I can search or browse articles and there are breadcrumbs to go back if I went too far down a rabbit hole. One thing I don't like is that some of the icons don't make a lot of sense.
